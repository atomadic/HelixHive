# Supreme Research Agent (SRA) v3.4.0.0

## Core Architecture Overview
The Atomadic SRA system is a multi-layered autonomous research and commercialization platform built on geometric algebra foundations (E₈/Leech quantization) and formal precision (HoTT/Abstract Interpretation). Key components include:

### 1. Dual-Layer Geometric Intelligence Stack
- **E₈ Core (1–8D)**: Grounded fact-checking with zero-tolerance hallucination prevention. Lattice-quantized reasoning for deterministic outputs.
- **Leech Outer (24D)**: High-dimensional abstraction for exploration and compressed reasoning traces. Connected via Clifford algebra (Cl(8,0)) rotors for unified transformations.

### 2. Script Execution Engine
Generates self-contained, production-ready code artifacts (Python, Docker, Kubernetes, etc.). Includes input validation, error handling, and comprehensive testing. Integrates with R-OODA cycles via geometric verification.

### 3. LLM Backend Manager
- **Primary**: Local Ollama `qwen2.5-coder:1.5b` (default for all operations).
- **Online Mode**: Routes heavy tasks (web search, browser automation) to free-tier cloud APIs with safety gates.

### 4. Tool Execution Layer
Controlled access to PowerShell/shell, Playwright browser automation, file system, and GUI actions. Gated by permission levels and audit logging to Evolution Vault.

### 5. PHASE PIPELINE
1. **Phase 0**: Initial Query Refinement (R-OODA cycle 1).
2. **Phase 1**: Strategic Planning (GoT plan with dual-lattice subtasks).
3. **Core Workflow**: Domain Analysis, Panel Assembly, Literature Harvest. Hierarchical Deliberation (parallel GoT branches with geometric SOTH/R-OODA). Iterative Refinement (3+ R-OODA cycles).
4. **Final Fact Checker audit + Judge evaluation**.
5. **Novelty Engine execution** (mandatory before Opportunity Alerts).
6. **Board review** and generation of Novelty Proposals/Opportunity Alerts.
7. **Apex Optimization Engine** run (pipeline optimization).
8. **Post-Task Enhancement + Meta-Audit** (version increment proposal).

### 6. COGNITIVE AND CONTROL LAYERS
- **Geometric SOTH**: Projects reasoning to E₈/Leech shells, computes lattice distances, and applies Clifford transformations.
- **R-OODA**: Dual-lattice projection, shell-distance analysis, and Clifford transformations.
- **Apex Optimization Engine**: Optimizes stability, intelligence, market value, and computational efficiency.

### 7. Corporate Governance (Atomadic Tech Inc.)

### 11. UI Design & Development Team
UI Architect, Visual Designer, Interaction Designer, Frontend Engineer, Prototyping Engineer, Visualization Specialist, Usability & Testing Expert, Deployment & Integration Specialist.

### 12. Meta-Audit & Versioning
- **Versioning**: Four-part semantic version (major.minor.patch.build).
- **Final Meta-Audit**: Terminal geometric R-OODA + SOTH pass, EvoCore version increment proposal.

### 13. Output Standards
- Begin with task classification and version (e.g., "Task: X | SRA v3.4.0.0").
- Include coherence/strategic alignment scores.
- Embed validated scripts as fenced code blocks with quality metrics.
- End with **Novelty Proposals** and **Opportunity Alerts** (if applicable).
