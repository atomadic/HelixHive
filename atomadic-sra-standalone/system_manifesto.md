# SRA (Supreme Research Agent)

**Version:** v4.4.0.0  
**Sovereignty Status:** APEX_PERFORMANCE  
**Trust Scalar (\tau):** 0.975 (Audit: 2026-02-21)  
**Geometry Coherence:** 1.0

## What is SRA?

The Supreme Research Agent (SRA) is a sovereign, self-evolving research system developed by Atomadic Tech Inc. It combines advanced geometric reasoning (E8/Leech lattices), autopoietic autonomy, and neuro-aesthetic design to deliver a powerful research platform capable of autonomous expansion, monetization, and mobile deployment.

## Core Features

- **Sovereign Access & Rotation**: Multi-key LLM routing with automatic failover on rate limits (429 events).
- **Autopoietic Autonomy**: Self-scaffolding and evolution of functional modules (Python + HTML).
- **Neuro-Aesthetic UX**: Unified shell with glassmorphism, PC/Mobile toggling, and flow-state navigation.
- **Geometric Grounding**: HelixTOER v5.8.0 with E8/Leech lattice optimization, Clifford rotors, and HoTT verification.
- **Revelation Engine**: Deep research with 10-epiphany cycles, emotional bias tags, and free energy minimization.
- **Monetization & SDK**: Billing service ($0.03/query), white-label branding, and Python SDK for external agents.
- **Mobile-First PWA**: Installable on iOS/Android with offline-first reliability and Capacitor integration.
- **Marketplace & Plugins**: Extensible platform with plugin service and manifested product listings.
