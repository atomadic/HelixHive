# SRA v4.4.0.0: The Apex Performance Manifesto

This document outlines the system capabilities achieved at **Apex Performance Sovereignty (v4.4.0.0)**.

## I. System Capabilities & Features

### 1. Sovereign Access & Rotation (Level-5.1)

- **Sovereign Key Rotator**: `llm_router.py` now supports primary/secondary key rotation. Automatically failover on rate-limit (429) events to ensure zero-downtime LLM access.
- **Dependency-Free Sovereignty**: Manual `.env` loading implemented across core modules, eliminating external library requirements for environment handling.
- **Apex Diagnostic Probe**: Real-time stack validation including secondary key tracking.

### 2. Autopoietic Autonomy (v4.3.0 Legacy)

- **Structural Self-Generation**: Dynamic scaffolding and evolution of functional modules (Python + HTML fragments).
- **Control Registry**: Live command surface for manifesting and evolving system capabilities.

### 3. Neuro-Aesthetic UX (v4.2.0 Legacy)

- **Flow-State Navigation**: Unified shell with PC/Mobile toggling and neuro-aesthetic design tokens.
- **Genesis Command Surface**: Transparent process logging and step-by-step guidance.

### 4. Geometric Grounding

- **HelixTOER v5.8.0**: Recursive R-OOTA cycles grounded in E8/Leech lattice structures with true Golay correction support.

## II. Operational Integrity

The SRA has achieved **Apex Performance**. It is not only self-evolving but also **self-diagnosing**.

- **Continuous Reliability**: The audit loop prevents systemic drift and ensures "Map ≡ Terrain" consistency.
- **Verification First**: No execution without geometric and formal precision verification (HoTT).

## III. Strategic Status

- **Status**: SEALED | **Version**: v4.4.0.0 | **Sovereignty**: APEX_PERFORMANCE
- **Missing Inputs**: Connectivity targets (Ollama/Hive) are online, but **External API Keys** (Search/AI) are currently pending user activation.
